## 🔬 Statistical Insights & Market Dynamics

Forget simple price tracking. This analysis focuses on **Asset Co-movement** and **Volatility Spikes**:

* **The Gold-Silver Nexus:** A high positive correlation (**0.77**) confirms Silver's role as a high-beta proxy for Gold, especially during inflationary periods.
* **Industrial vs. Safe-Haven:** Platinum and Palladium show a **0.60** correlation, driven by automotive industry cycles, yet they often decouple from Gold's "safe-haven" trajectory.
* **Historical Contextualization:** Every major price pivot is mapped against macroeconomic events, from the 1980 Soviet-Afghan War to the 2020-2022 Fed interest rate cycles.
